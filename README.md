# GDocs Make H3s White
This is just a simple example repo containing some helper functions for some of my google docs. 

To use locally, it's recommended to first take the [clasp codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/clasp/#0) 
and use similar instructions to push up to your doc if wanted.
